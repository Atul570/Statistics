    "### Sampleing Distribution :- \n",
    "\n",
    "A sampling distribution of a statistic is a type of probability distribution created by drawing many random samples of a given size from the same population. These distributions help you understand how a sample statistic varies from sample to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling distributions are essential for inferential statistics because they allow you to understand a specific sample statistic in the broader context of other possible values. Crucially, they let you calculate probabilities associated with your sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling distributions describe the assortment of values for all manner of sample statistics. While the sampling distribution of the mean is the most common type, they can characterize other statistics, such as the median, standard deviation, range, correlation, and test statistics in hypothesis tests. \n"

    "### Sampling Distribution of the Mean Example:-\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, I want you to fully understand the concept of a sampling distribution. So, here’s a simple example!\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you draw a random sample of 10 apples. Then you calculate the mean of that sample as 103 grams. That’s one sample mean from one sample. However, you realize that if you were to draw another sample, you’d obtain a different mean. A third sample would produce yet another mean. And so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, suppose you decide to collect 50 random samples of the same apple population. Each sample contains 10 apples, and you calculate the mean for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated Apple Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "    At this point, you have 50 sample means for apple weights. You plot these sample means in the histogram below to display your sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/sampling_distribution_mean_example.webp\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram shows us that our initial sample mean of 103 falls near the center of the sampling distribution. Means occur in this range the most frequently—18 of the 50 samples (36%) fall within the middle bar. However, other samples from the same population have higher and lower means. The frequency of means is highest in the sampling distribution center and tapers off in both directions. None of our 50 sample means fall outside the range of 85-118. Consequently, it is very unusual to obtain sample means outside this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you don’t know the population parameters. Instead, you use samples to estimate them. However, we know the parameters for this simulation because I’ve set the population to follow a normal distribution with a mean (µ) weight of 100 grams and a standard deviation (σ) of 15 grams. Those are the parameters of the apple population from which we’ve been sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the histogram centers on the population mean of 100, and sample means become rarer further away. It’s also a reasonably symmetric distribution. Those are features of many sampling distributions. This distribution isn’t particularly smooth because 50 samples is a small number for this purpose, as you’ll see.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Distributions of the Mean for Normal Distributions:-\n",
