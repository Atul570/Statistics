    "\n",
    "### **Two-Tailed Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Detects effects in both directions**  \n",
    "   Useful when we are unsure about the direction of the effect.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ A teacher wants to test if a new teaching method leads to a **change** in test scores (either improvement or decline).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **More conservative (lower Type I error risk)**  \n",
    "   Since Œ± is split into two tails, there's a lower risk of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ A pharmaceutical company uses two-tailed tests to be extra cautious before declaring a new drug is better or worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Less powerful**  \n",
    "   Because Œ± is divided between two tails, it may need a stronger signal (effect size) to reject H‚ÇÄ.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ A small improvement in recovery rate may not be detected if we use a two-tailed test, even if it's real.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not suitable for directional hypotheses**  \n",
    "   When your research question is clearly one-directional, two-tailed tests might be overkill.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ If you're only interested in **improving** test scores, testing for both directions isn‚Äôt necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **One-Tailed Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More powerful**  \n",
    "   Entire Œ± is in one tail, increasing the ability to detect a real effect in the expected direction.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ A manager wants to check if a new process **increases** production speed. A one-tailed test would more easily show significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Good for directional hypotheses**  \n",
    "   Ideal when theory or logic strongly supports checking for effect in only one direction.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ A scientist tests if a fertilizer **increases** plant growth based on prior studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missed effects in opposite direction**  \n",
    "   If the effect goes in the opposite direction, it won't be detected.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ You test whether a drug improves health, but it actually makes it worse ‚Äî a one-tailed test won‚Äôt catch that!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Higher risk of Type I error (if misused)**  \n",
    "   If you wrongly assume the direction and use one-tailed testing, you might conclude there‚Äôs an effect when it's just random variation.  \n",
    "   _Example:_ Choosing a one-tailed test just to get significant results (p-hacking) can lead to wrong scientific conclusions.\n",
