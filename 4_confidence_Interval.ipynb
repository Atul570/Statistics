    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that best estimates a population parameter. Point estimation uses a random sample to estimate the population value(Parameter). For example, the sample mean estimates the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation is a key goal of inferential statistics. This branch of statistics uses random samples to estimate the properties of entire populations. Parameters are population properties, such as the population mean. Unfortunately, they are generally unknowable because measuring a whole population is difficult. However, sample statistics calculated from a random sample can estimate the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics, estimation methods generally fall into two main types: point estimates, which provide a single best guess, and interval estimates, which offer a range of plossible values. While other estimation approaches exist in more advanced settings, these two categories form the foundation of most statistical inference.\n",

    "**Properties of a Good Point Estimate:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "A good point estimate is consistent, unbiased, and efficient. All these terms have specific meanings in a statistical context. Let’s learn more about them!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistent Estimate:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent point estimate means that the estimate tends to get closer to the population parameter as the sample size increases. Imagine trying to estimate the average height of all adult women in a city. If you only measure 10 women, your estimate will be off by some amount. However, as you measure the heights of more and more women, a consistent estimator will converge on the correct population value. It tends to get closer and closer to the parameter with larger samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unbaised Estimate:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "An unbiased estimator is a point estimate that is not consistently too high or too low compared to the population parameter. For example, if you take multiple random samples of adult women and measure their heights, the sample means won’t systematically overestimate or underestimate the population’s average height. Additionally, if you average multiple unbiased point estimates, the average tends to converge on the correct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficency:-**\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency in point estimates means getting the most accurate result possible with the least amount of data. Using the example of estimating the average height of all adults in a city, an efficient estimator makes the best use of the data you collect, providing an estimate with minimal variability.\n",

    "**🔁 Why Do We Use the T-Distribution Instead of Z?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When the population standard deviation (σ) is unknown, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation (s). This estimate introduces extra variability into the process. Hence, instead of using the standard normal (Z) distribution, we use the t-distribution, which adjusts for that extra uncertainty — especially for small sample sizes (n < 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "**📘 Assumptions for Using the T-Procedure (σ Unknown):-**\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the t-procedure correctly when constructing confidence intervals or performing hypothesis testing about a population mean, the following assumptions must be satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Sampling:-\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; *-- The data must be collected using a random sampling method.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- This ensures the sample is representative of the population.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- It helps to minimize bias and allows the results to be generalized to the entire population.*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Population Standard Deviation (σ) is Unknown:-\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; *-- Since the true population standard deviation σ is not known, we use the sample standard deviation (s) as an estimate.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- The t-distribution accounts for the extra variability introduced by estimating σ using s.*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Approximately Normal Population Distribution:-\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; *-- The population should be approximately normally distributed, especially when the sample size is small (n < 30).*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- If the sample size is large, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) ensures the sampling distribution of the mean is<br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;approximately normal, even if the population is not.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- ⚠️ Caution: If the data is heavily skewed or has extreme outliers, the t-procedure may not be reliable. <br>\n",
    "&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In such cases, consider using non-parametric methods.*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Independence of Observations:-\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; *-- Each observation in the sample must be independent of the others.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- That means the value of one observation should not influence or be related to another.*<br>\n",
    "&emsp; *-- This is especially important in cases like time series data, where values can be correlated.*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ If all four assumptions are met, the t-procedure gives a reliable method for estimating population means and conducting inference when σ is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**What is T-Distribution ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Student's t-distribution, also known as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that is used in statistics for making inferences about the population mean when the sample size is small or when the population standard deviation is unknown. It is similar to the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution), but it has heavier tails. Theoretical work on t-distribution was done by W.S. Gosset; he has published his findings under the pen name \"Student\". That's why it is called a Student's t-test. The t-score represents the number of standard deviations the sample mean is away from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Looks similar to normal distribution, but with fatter tails\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Fatter tails = more spread, which compensates for the extra uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "-- As sample size increases, the t-distribution becomes more like Z (normal distribution)\n",

    "Degrees of freedom is a combination of how much data you have and how many parameters you need to estimate. It indicates how much independent information goes into a parameter estimate. In this vein, it’s easy to see that you want a lot of information to go into parameter estimates to obtain more precise estimates and more powerful hypothesis tests. So, you want many DF!\n",

Estimating the parameter, the mean in this case, imposes a constraint on the freedom to vary. The last value and the mean are entirely dependent on each other. Consequently, after estimating the mean, we have only 9 independent pieces of information, even though our sample size is 10.\n",
