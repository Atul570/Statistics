    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **What is Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a **regularized version of Linear Regression** that adds a penalty term to reduce model complexity and prevent **overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🚨 It helps when we have **multicollinearity** (features are highly correlated) or when the number of features is **close to or greater than** the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Why do we need it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordinary linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + w_n x_n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Of course, ATUL! Let’s break it down carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(w) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what each part means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y_i$: actual target value for the $i$-th data point.\n",
    "* $\\hat{y}_i$: predicted value for the $i$-th data point.\n",
    "* $x_i$: the feature vector (a column vector) for the $i$-th data point.\n",
    "* $w$: the weight vector (also a column vector) that our model is trying to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, **$w^T x_i$** means the transpose of $w$ multiplied by $x_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $w^T$: transpose of the weight vector $w$.\n",
    "* When you do $w^T x_i$, you get a scalar (single number), which becomes the prediction $\\hat{y}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why transpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "If:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ (a column vector with $d$ elements).\n",
    "* $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ (also a column vector with $d$ elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $w^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}$ is a row vector.\n",
    "* $w^T x_i$ is then a dot product, resulting in a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **$w^T x_i$** is the predicted value for the $i$-th observation in a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are **too many features**\n",
    "* Or features are **highly correlated**\n",
    "\n",
    "→ The model becomes **unstable**, and coefficients may become large.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Ridge Regression Loss Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge adds a **penalty** (regularization term):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ridge}}(w) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w^T x_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} w_j^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\lambda$ = Regularization parameter (controls penalty strength)\n",
    "* $\\sum w_j^2$ = L2 norm (squared magnitude of weights)\n",
    "* Note: Bias term $w_0$ is often not penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Key Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ridge **shrinks the weights**, but **doesn’t make them exactly zero**.\n",
    "* Controls overfitting by adding **bias** to reduce **variance**.\n",
