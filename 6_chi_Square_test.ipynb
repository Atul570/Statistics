    "The **Chi-Square distribution** is a type of probability distribution commonly used in **statistical hypothesis testing**. It plays a key role in tests that measure how well an observed dataset fits an expected pattern, such as **goodness-of-fit tests** and **tests for independence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works**\n",
    "- It arises when we sum the **squares** of independent standard normal variables (standard normal distribution).\n",
    "- The **degrees of freedom (df)** determine its shape and spread. More degrees of freedom lead to a more **symmetrical shape**.\n",
    "- It is always **non-negative**, meaning values cannot be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties**\n",
    "1. **Continuous distribution:** It deals with a range of possible values rather than discrete outcomes.\n",
    "2. **Positively skewed:** The distribution leans to the right, but as **degrees of freedom increase**, it **starts resembling a normal distribution**.\n",
    "3. **Mean & Variance:** \n",
    "   - Mean = Degrees of freedom (df)\n",
    "   - Variance = **2 × Degrees of freedom**\n",
    "4. **Approaches normal distribution** as degrees of freedom increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where It’s Used**\n",
    "- **Goodness-of-Fit Test:** Determines if an observed dataset matches an expected distribution.\n",
    "- **Test for Independence:** Used in contingency tables to check relationships between categorical variables.66\n",

    "The **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test** helps determine whether the observed data of a **single categorical variable** matches an expected theoretical distribution (such as uniform, binomial, or Poisson). It is useful for checking whether sample data follows a specific probability pattern or significantly deviates from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Involved**\n",
    "1. **Define Hypotheses**  \n",
    "   - **Null hypothesis (H₀):** The observed data follows the expected theoretical distribution.  \n",
    "   - **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** The observed data does **not** follow the expected theoretical distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Expected Frequencies**  \n",
    "   - Use the theoretical distribution and sample size to estimate the expected values for each category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute the Chi-Square Test Statistic**  \n",
    "   - The formula used is:  \n",
    "     $$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$  \n",
    "     - Where:\n",
    "       - $O_i$ = Observed frequency of category $i$\n",
    "       - $E_i$ = Expected frequency of category $i$\n",
    "       - The summation runs over all categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine Degrees of Freedom (df)**  \n",
    "   - Formula: **df = (Number of categories - 1)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the p-value**  \n",
    "   - Compare the test statistic ($\\chi^2$) to the **Chi-Square distribution** based on the degrees of freedom.  \n",
    "   - If the **p-value is small (typically < 0.05)**, reject the **null hypothesis**, meaning the data does **not** fit the expected distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Assumptions**\n",
    "- **Independent observations:** Each data point must be independent.\n",
    "- **Categorical data:** The variable being analyzed must be categorical (not continuous).\n",
    "- **Expected frequencies:** Each category should have an expected frequency of at least **5** for reliable results.\n",
    "- **Fixed distribution:** The theoretical distribution being compared to the observed data should be specified before the test is conducted. It is essential to avoid choosing a distribution based on the observed data, as doing so can lead to biased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test is a non-parametric test. Non- parametric tests do not assume that the data comes from a specific probability distribution or make any assumptions about population parameters like the mean or standard deviation.**\n",
